Challenge 4: 
Build a food ordering system where the user inputs the food name into the food order and then the order gets 
passed to the appropriate restaurant on a list and the restaurant prints the receipt on stdout. No need to create a 
UI, a main function that receives parameters is enough.
For example: 
 Input: “pepperoni pizza”
 Output: "Awesome pizza place, pepperoni pizza, $20”
For example: 
 Input: “burger”
 Output: “wild burger joint, burger, $15”
